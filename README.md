## Computational Neuroscience Mini-Projects 

This repository showcases a series of mini-projects developed during the Theoretical Neuroscience course at KAIST. The projects explore mathematical and computational models of neural activity — from single-neuron dynamics to sensory coding and decision-making — using tools from differential equations, stochastic modeling, and information theory.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
Each project investigates a key concept in computational neuroscience:

🔌 Neuron Modeling
Simulations of Izhikevich, Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), and Hodgkin–Huxley models.

📊 Neural Coding & Information Theory
Spike train generation, entropy, Fano factor, and spike count variability.

🔁 Synaptic Plasticity
Implementation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rules.

🧠 Neural Network Dynamics
Synchronization, noise-driven dynamics, and coupled LIF neurons.

👁️ Receptive Fields & Reverse Correlation
Gabor filter generation and receptive field reconstruction.

🧮 Decision Making Models
Neural accumulation models and ROC curve analysis.
