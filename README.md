1 # Computational Neuroscience Mini-Projects (BCS304)
    2 
    3 This repository contains a collection of mini-projects developed as part of a Theoretical Neuroscience course (BCS304). These projects explore fundamental concepts and
      computational models in neuroscience, ranging from single-neuron dynamics to neural network interactions and information processing.
    4 
    5 ## Project Overview
    6 
    7 The projects cover a variety of topics, including:
    8 -   **Neuron Modeling:** Simulation and analysis of various neuron models (Izhikevich, Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Hodgkin-Huxley).
    9 -   **Neural Coding & Information Theory:** Investigation of spike train generation (Poisson processes), analysis of spike patterns, and calculation of information
      entropy.
   10 -   **Synaptic Plasticity:** Implementation and study of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
   11 -   **Neural Network Dynamics:** Exploration of coupled neuron behavior, including synchronous and alternating firing patterns.
   12 -   **Receptive Fields & Reverse Correlation:** Simulation of visual stimuli and reconstruction of neuronal receptive fields.
   13 -   **Decision Making:** Modeling and analysis of neural decision-making processes.

   15 ## Folder Structure
   16 
   17 Each subfolder corresponds to a set of mini-projects or assignments:
   18 
   19 -   **`Final_project/`**: Focuses on advanced Izhikevich neuron modeling, STDP, spike pattern analysis, and perceptron implementation.
   20 -   **`midterm_project/`**: Contains projects on Poisson spike generators, Fano factor estimation, and Gabor receptive field analysis using reverse correlation.
   21 -   **`project1/`**: Explores the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model, including firing rate estimation, noise effects, and response functions.
   22 -   **`project2/`**: Delves into the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model, spike timing detection, and the dynamics of coupled LIF neurons with and without noise.
   23 -   **`project3/`**: Covers analysis of neural responses to stimuli, decision-making models, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
   24 -   **`project4/`**: Concentrates on entropy calculations for spike-count distributions, comparing Poisson and exponential coding schemes.
   25 
   26 Each project folder typically includes MATLAB code (`.m` files) and corresponding PDF reports or answer sheets detailing the problem statements, methods, results, and
      discussions.
