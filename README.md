# 🧠 Computational Neuroscience Mini-Projects (BCS304)

This repository contains a series of mini-projects developed as part of the *Theoretical Neuroscience* course at KAIST. The goal is to understand the computational principles behind neural systems — from single-neuron dynamics to decision-making — using mathematical modeling, simulation, and data analysis.

## 🧩 Project Topics

Each project focuses on a key concept in computational neuroscience:

- 🔌 **Neuron Modeling**  
  Izhikevich, Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), and Hodgkin–Huxley models.

- 📊 **Neural Coding & Information Theory**  
  Poisson spike trains, entropy, Fano factor, spike pattern statistics.

- 🔁 **Synaptic Plasticity**  
  Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and learning rules.

- 🌐 **Neural Network Dynamics**  
  Coupled neurons, noise effects, synchronization.

- 👁️ **Receptive Fields**  
  Gabor filters and reverse correlation for visual stimuli.

- 🧮 **Decision Making**  
  Signal detection theory, ROC curves, accumulation models.
